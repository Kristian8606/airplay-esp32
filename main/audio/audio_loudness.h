/* Loudness compensation (ISO 226 equal-loudness contours).
 *
 * As the output is turned down, the ear loses bass (and a little of the top
 * end) faster than the midrange. Two shelving filters, fitted to ISO 226
 * (reference 80 phon, within 0.6 dB from 31.5 Hz to 10 kHz for 10..30 dB of
 * attenuation), put that back in proportion to how far the output is below
 * the reference level:
 *
 *   low shelf  130 Hz, slope 0.4, gain 0.52 dB per dB of attenuation
 *   high shelf 10.5 kHz, slope 1.0, gain 0.15 dB per dB of attenuation
 *
 * Attenuation = output level below the reference (the output gain set by the
 * AirPlay volume, minus the user's reference offset), limited to 40 dB. The
 * boost is always smaller than the attenuation, so the result never exceeds
 * full scale.
 *
 * Runs in the playout task right after the output volume, so it follows the
 * volume at once (the EQ runs before the PCM buffer, seconds earlier). When
 * off, or at the reference level, the output is left bit-exact. */
